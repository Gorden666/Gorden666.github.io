I am from China and graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Physics from the Zhiyuan College of Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2024. I am a master's student at the Abbe School of Photonics at the University of Jena in Germany, and a participant in the Max Planck School of Photonics (MPSP) program. My research interests include optical design, femtosecond lasers, and fiber lasers.
